Twitter Follower Based Card Game

__Contributors__: Jorge Torres-Aldana  
__Language(s)__: Android Java  
__Libraries__: ButterKnife, Piccaso, TwitterAPI

__Description__: This application allows users to sign into their Twitter account, which then takes advantage of Twitter's API to return friend data. The application makes use of this data to create cards which allows users to play a Hearthstone-esque game. Gameplay is made interactive thanks to the use of Android's OnTouch and OnDrag functionality.

__Notes__: As is, the application will not work. It requires valid Twitter API keys. These, along with their location files, have been removed for security reasons. Below can be found examples of what the application looks like.

__Future Features__:
* Firebase implementation
* PVE funtionality
* PVP Functionality

__Example__:
Coming Soon
